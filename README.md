Devloped in Visual Studio 2022 using C++ 14 Standard.

All .wav files must be located in the same directory as the .exe. They can be in a folder as long as that folder is in the 
same folder as the .exe or the solution, depending on the method you choose to run.

The program contains shortcuts for easier use but only for the test samples provided on Canvas.
These shortcuts must be stored in "test samples/Q1" where "test samples" is in the same directory as the .exe and the solution.

### Please note that the .exe version does have better performance so I recommend using that vs running the program in Visual Studio
